# üçÇ Popka

Popka is a lightweight and beginner-friendly 2D game engine for the D programming language.
It focuses on providing a simple and easy-to-understand foundation for building 2D games.
The game engine is currently under development and is not yet ready for use.

```d
import popka.basic;

void main() {
    openWindow(800, 600);
    while (isWindowOpen) {
        if (Keyboard.q.isPressed) {
            closeWindow();
        }
    }
    freeWindow();
}
```
