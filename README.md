# ðŸ¦† Parin

A delightfully simple 2D game engine for the [D programming language](https://dlang.org/). Parin is designed to make game development fun â€” it's easy to set up and lets you jump right into making things.

## Hello World Example

```d
import parin;

// Called once when the game starts.
void ready() {
    lockResolution(320, 180);
}

// Called every frame while the game is running.
// If true is returned, then the game will stop running.
bool update(float dt) {
    drawDebugText("Hello world!", Vec2(8));
    return false;
}

// Called once when the game ends.
void finish() {}

// Creates a main function that calls the given functions.
mixin runGame!(ready, update, finish);
```

## Quick Start

This guide shows how to install Parin and its dependencies using [DUB](https://dub.pm/).
Create a new folder and run inside the following commands:

```cmd
dub init -n
dub run parin:setup -- -y
dub run
```

If everything is set up correctly, a window will appear showing the message "Hello world!".

### Required Libraries on Linux

Some libraries for sound, graphics, and input handling are required before using Parin on Linux. Below are installation commands for some Linux distributions.

**Ubuntu**:

```cmd
sudo apt install libasound2-dev libx11-dev libxrandr-dev libxi-dev libgl1-mesa-dev libglu1-mesa-dev libxcursor-dev libxinerama-dev libwayland-dev libxkbcommon-dev
```

**Fedora**:

```cmd
sudo dnf install alsa-lib-devel mesa-libGL-devel libX11-devel libXrandr-devel libXi-devel libXcursor-devel libXinerama-devel libatomic
```

**Arch**:

```cmd
sudo pacman -S alsa-lib mesa libx11 libxrandr libxi libxcursor libxinerama
```

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is Parin a raylib wrapper?

No. Raylib is just the current backend.
A custom backend may be added in the future, but it's not a priority right now.

### What are Parin's priorities?

Ease of use and helpful tooling are the main focus.
The goal is a smooth experience, similar to Godot or Unity.

### Are the Parin assets free to use?

Yes. The assets are free to use for any purpose, even commercially.
Be sure to check the associated [README](assets/README.md) for any licensing notes.

### How can I load an asset outside of the assets folder?

By default, assets are loaded from the assets folder.
To load from a different location, call `setIsUsingAssetsPath(false)` to disable this behavior.

### How can I hot reload assets?

Asset hot reloading is not supported out of the box.
The [arsd](https://github.com/adamdruppe/arsd) libraries may help, but with Parin alone, you can manually reload assets like this:

```d
bool update(float dt) {
    // Reload the texture whenever the 0 key is pressed.
    if ('0'.isPressed) {
        atlas.free();
        atlas = loadTexture("parin_atlas.png");
    }
    drawTexture(atlas, Vec2(8));
    return false;
}
```
