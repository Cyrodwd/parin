# TODO

## NOW

Cleaning things in core.

* [x] ascii
* [x] colors
* [x] containers
* [x] errors
* [ ] io
* [ ] math
* [ ] package
* [ ] stdc
* [ ] traits
* [ ] types
* [ ] unions

Done with ascii.
Now I am thinking of making the io module better.
For example, readin does not tell you right now if something went wrong.
It just returns an empty list.

## IDEAS

* doubleToStr
* GUI
* HashMap
* LinearAllocator
* Random
* Docs
* Remove asserts from dialogue module.
* Make pathDir more lenient.
* Fix config loading.
* Add line limit and text alignment to font drawing.
