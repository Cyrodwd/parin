This file provides an overview of my likes and dislikes to help others understand what I am trying to make/avoid.

## Things I Like

* Processing: No bureaucracy. No OOP or 50+ ways to configure the program. Just use the setup and draw functions.
* RPG Maker: The "www" folder and the game UI. Both are simple and easy to understand.
* Lua Libraries: They tend to have good ideas. Anim8 is a good example.
* Godot 3: A tiny part of the API is nice.

## Things I Dislike

* Godot 3+: Error handling, file system, resources, signals, tile maps, sprite animations... The list is too long.
* Scripting Languages: You already have a good programming language.
* OOP/SOLID/DAD: Just focus on the data, the procedures and the goal. Everything else is bureaucracy.
* Safe Code: Most people have a different idea about what it means, so it's usually not worth thinking about it.
* RAII: One of the solutions to make code "safe". Not worth thinking about it.
